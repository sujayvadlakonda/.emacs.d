I have been using Emacs since 2018.
I have been learning about Emacs and Lisp by attempting to roll my own configurations.
Previous Emacs configurations can be found [here](https://github.com/sujayvadlakonda/old-emacs/tree/bankruptcy2) and [here](https://github.com/sujayvadlakonda/old-emacs-2/tree/master)
